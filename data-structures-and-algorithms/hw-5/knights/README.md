## Knights ##
There's a group of knights in the magical world of Algorithmia.
Whenever they don't have any battle they like to play a game between themselves:
the knights which are N gather around in a circle. They are numbered from 1 to N, and the knight on the left of 1 is number 2, on the left of 2 is 3 and so on.
On the left of the knight with the number N stands the knight numbered 1.
The game starts with the knight numbered 1 who eliminates the one on left of him(number 2).
Afterwards the next undefeated knight on the left of 1 must repeat the process, as the game keeps on until there is only one knight left.
Your task is to output his number.
