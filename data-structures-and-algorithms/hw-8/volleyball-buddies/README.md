## Volleyball buddies ##
There is a volleyball tournament and only the best N+1 candidates are invited to participate. One of the children of the organizers is already signed up for the tournament.
The rest have a condition - they do not want to participate unless their best friends are already signed up for the tournament.<br/>
Each student has a personal number used to recognize him. The numbers don't have a particular order and could even be negative.
Each student knows the number of his or more best friends, whose presence might motivate him/her to participate.<br/>
The friendship relationship is one-sided. That means that if 1 assumes 2 to be his best friend it is not necessary that 1 is the best friend of 2.<br/>
Based on this knowledge find out the number of people within the final squad.
### Input format ###
On the first row is given a number m - the number of the first student.<br/>
On the second row is given a number N. On the next N rows you receive pairs of numbers separated by spaces.
The first of the corresponds to the number of the best friend who must already be into the team.
If it is so the second student(represented by the second number) joins the squad.
On each row your only interest is the current content of the squad, no matter what may follow afterwards.
