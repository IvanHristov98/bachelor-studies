## Long Long ##
You are given an oriented and weighted graph with weights that are whole numbers. Find the length of the longest path from vertex s to vertex t.
Assume that there are no cycles with a positive price within the graph.
The nodes of the graph are labeled from 1 to n.
### Input format ###
On the standard input are given the numbers n, m, s and t, where:<br/>
n - number of vertices within the graph<br/>
m - number of edges within the graph<br/>
s - starting vertex<br/>
t - final vertex<br/>
They are followed by m rows each containing three numbers - v1, v2 and w, where:<br/>
v1 - source of the edge<br/>
v2 - destination of the edge<br/>
w - weight of the edge
### Output format ###
On the standard output is expected a number representing the length of longest path between v1 and v2.
If there is no such path output -1.
