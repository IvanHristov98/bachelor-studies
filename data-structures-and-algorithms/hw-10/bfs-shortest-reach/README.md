## BFS shortest reach ##
Consider an undirected graph where each edge is the same weight. Each of the nodes is labeled consecutively.

You will be given a number of queries. For each query, you will be given a list of edges describing an undirected graph. After you create a representation of the graph, you must determine and report the shortest distance to each of the other nodes from a given starting position using the breadth-first search algorithm (BFS). Distances are to be reported in node number order, ascending. If a node is unreachable, print
for that node. Each of the edges weighs 6 units of distance.
