## Tasks in data structures and algorithms ##
This directory represents a series of tasks I've been given during my course in data structures and algorithms.<br/>
<b>Note</b> out that all of the tasks have a competitive behaviour which may often lead to a missing destructor within a class and/or similar 'errors'.

The tasks are listed in:<br/>
[Homework-1](./hw-1)<br/>
[Homework-2](./hw-2)<br/>
[Homework-3](./hw-3)<br/>
[Homework-4](./hw-4)<br/>
[Homework-5](./hw-5)<br/>
[Homework-7](./hw-7)<br/>
[Homework-8](./hw-8)<br/>
