### Substring permutation ###
You are given two strings a and b, containing only lower-case latin letters. Write down a program that finds the string with the greatest length, that is simultaneously a substring of a permutation of a and a substring of a permutation of b.
For the task assume that a permutation of a string named foo is a string with the same length that contains the letters of foo in some order.
## Input format ##
On the standard input you are given two strings, each on a separate row. The maximum length of each is 1000 characters.
