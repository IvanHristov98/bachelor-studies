## Store promotion ##
Grandpa Todor has a great family - three sons and nine grandsons. And all of them need to be well fed. That's why he goes on a weekly schedule to the store.
When he's entered the store today he's seen that there's been an action called "every k-th stock for free". The rules of the action are as follows:
The buyer shows the stocks on the cash desk into the store and receives a check. If the check is for n stocks then n/k(rounded downwards) from the cheapest stocks are for free.
Grandpa Todor then picked the stocks and went to the cash desk, and was blissed by the thought that he could separate the stocks into groups and spend less money.
Write down a program that could calculate the minimum sum grandpa Todor has to pay for the stocks.
### Input format ###
On the first row of the standard input are given two numbers n and k - respectively the number of the stocks and the parameter of the action.
On the next row are given n integers ai - the prices of the stocks. The numbers are separated by an interval.
